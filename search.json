    "text": "Exercise 1: Research Questions\nLet’s dig into the hikes data, starting with the elevation and difficulty ratings of the hikes:\n\nhead(hikes)\n\n             peak elevation difficulty ascent length time    rating\n1     Mt. Marcy        5344          5   3166   14.8 10.0  moderate\n2 Algonquin Peak       5114          5   2936    9.6  9.0  moderate\n3   Mt. Haystack       4960          7   3570   17.8 12.0 difficult\n4   Mt. Skylight       4926          7   4265   17.9 15.0 difficult\n5 Whiteface Mtn.       4867          4   2535   10.4  8.5      easy\n6       Dix Mtn.       4857          5   2800   13.2 10.0  moderate\n\n\n\nWhat features would we like a visualization of the categorical difficulty rating variable to capture? How many hikes fall into each category.\nWhat about a visualization of the quantitative elevation variable? Order of peaks by elevation.\n\n\n\nExercise 2: Load tidyverse\nWe’ll address the above questions using ggplot tools. Try running the following chunk and simply take note of the error message – this is one you’ll get a lot!\n\n# Use the ggplot function\n# ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))\n\nIn order to use ggplot tools, we have to first load the tidyverse package in which they live. We’ve installed the package but we need to tell R when we want to use it. Run the chunk below to load the library. You’ll need to do this within any .qmd file that uses ggplot().\n\n# Load the package\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 1\nConsider some specific research questions about the difficulty rating of the hikes:\n\nHow many hikes fall into each category?\nAre the hikes evenly distributed among these categories, or are some more common than others?\n\nAll of these questions can be answered with: (1) a bar chart; of (2) the categorical data recorded in the rating column. First, set up the plotting frame:\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about:\n\nWhat did this do? What do you observe? Created the framework for a bar chart with categories on the x-axis.\nWhat, in general, is the first argument of the ggplot() function? Data type of individual cases being visualized.\nWhat is the purpose of writing x = rating? Returns difficulty rating for each case.\nWhat do you think aes stands for?!? Aesthetic\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 2\nNow let’s add a geometric layer to the frame / canvas, and start customizing the plot’s theme. To this end, try each chunk below, one by one. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.\nNOTE:\n\nPay attention to the general code properties and structure, not memorization.\nNot all of these are “good” plots. We’re just exploring ggplot.\n\n\n# Adds a 'count' variable on the y-axis. Creates bars based on the number of hikes in each category.\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Manually labels the x- and y- axes.\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Makes every bar in the graph blue.\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Gives each bar an orange outline.\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Removes the gray background.\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\")  +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5: Bar Chart Follow-up\n\nPart a\nReflect on the ggplot() code.\n\nWhat’s the purpose of the +? When do we use it? The ‘+’ operator combines lines of code. We use it to execute multiple lines simultaneously.\nWe added the bars using geom_bar()? Why “geom”? “Geom” stands for geometry. ‘Geom_bar()’ generates bar shapes.\nWhat does labs() stand for? Labels\nWhat’s the difference between color and fill? ‘Color’ determines a shape’s outline color. ‘Fill’ determines a shape’s fill color.\n\n\n\nPart b\nIn general, bar charts allow us to examine the following properties of a categorical variable:\n\nobserved categories: What categories did we observe? Difficulty rating, number of hikes per difficulty.\nvariability between categories: Are observations evenly spread out among the categories, or are some categories more common than others? The majority of hikes are ‘moderate’ difficulty.\n\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Summarize below what you learned from the bar chart, in context. Out of the forty-six hikes included in this data set, most (27) were of a moderate difficulty. Some (11) were of an easy difficulty, and even less (8) were of a hard difficulty.\n\n\nPart c\nIs there anything you don’t like about this barplot? For example: check out the x-axis again. I would prefer if the x-axis was ordered ‘easy - moderate - hard’ instead of ‘easy - hard - moderate’.\n\n\n\nExercise 6: Sad Bar Chart\nLet’s now consider some research questions related to the quantitative elevation variable:\n\nAmong the hikes, what’s the range of elevation and how are the hikes distributed within this range (e.g. evenly, in clumps, “normally”)? Range: 3820ft - 5344ft Relatively normal distribution.\nWhat’s a typical elevation? 4400ft\nAre there any outliers, i.e. hikes that have unusually high or low elevations? There are extremes in the data set but no outliers. Here:\n\n\nConstruct a bar chart of the quantitative elevation variable.\nExplain why this might not be an effective visualization for this and other quantitative variables. (What questions does / doesn’t it help answer?)\n\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not an effective visualization because it does not illustrate the distribution of elevation values. It simply tells us that most hikes have unique elevations, which is not interesting or relevant.\n\n\nExercise 7: A Histogram of Elevation\nQuantitative variables require different viz than categorical variables. Especially when there are many possible outcomes of the quantitative variable. It’s typically insufficient to simply count up the number of times we’ve observed a particular outcome as the bar graph did above. It gives us a sense of ranges and typical outcomes, but not a good sense of how the observations are distributed across this range. We’ll explore two methods for graphing quantitative variables: histograms and density plots.\nHistograms are constructed by (1) dividing up the observed range of the variable into ‘bins’ of equal width; and (2) counting up the number of cases that fall into each bin. Check out the example below:\n\n\nPart a\nLet’s dig into some details.\n\nHow many hikes have an elevation between 4500 and 4700 feet? Six hikes.\nHow many total hikes have an elevation of at least 5100 feet? Two hikes. #### Part b {.unnumbered}\n\nNow the bigger picture. In general, histograms allow us to examine the following properties of a quantitative variable:\n\ntypical outcome: Where’s the center of the data points? What’s typical? A typical outcome lies between 4000 and 4700 ft. 4350ft is the roughly the center.\nvariability & range: How spread out are the outcomes? What are the max and min outcomes? The outcomes are spread normally. The min outcome is 3820ft and the max outcome is 5344 ft.\nshape: How are values distributed along the observed range? Is the distribution symmetric, right-skewed, left-skewed, bi-modal, or uniform (flat)? The distribution is right-skewed.\noutliers: Are there any outliers, i.e. outcomes that are unusually large/small? There are two outliers at the highest elevation value. We must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Addressing each of the features in the above list, summarize below what you learned from the histogram, in context. According to this sample, the vast majority of hikes in the Adirondacks have an elevation between 4000 and 4700 ft.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 8: Building Histograms - Part 1\n2-MINUTE CHALLENGE: Thinking of the bar chart code, try to intuit what line you can tack on to the below frame of elevation to add a histogram layer. Don’t forget a +. If it doesn’t come to you within 2 minutes, no problem – all will be revealed in the next exercise.\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9: Building Histograms - Part 2\nLet’s build some histograms. Try each chunk below, one by one. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.\n\n# Generates a histogram measuring elevation on the x-axis and number of hikes in each elevation bin on the y-axis.\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Creates a white outline around each bar.\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") \n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Changes the fill color of each bar to blue.\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", fill = \"blue\") \n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Changes the bars to gray with white outlines. Manually labels the x- and y- axes.\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Changes each bin to represent all hikes within a range of 1000 ft.\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 1000) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Changes each bin to represent all hikes within a range of 5 ft.\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 5) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Changes each bin to represent all hikes within a range of 200 ft.\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 10: Histogram Follow-up\n\nWhat function added the histogram layer / geometry? The geo_histogram() function added the histogram layer.\nWhat’s the difference between color and fill? ‘Color’ changes the outline color. ‘Fill’ changes the fill color.\nWhy does adding color = \"white\" improve the visualization? It adds white outlines to each bar, making it easier to distinguish between bins.\nWhat did binwidth do? ‘Binwidth’ changes the range of values represented by each bin.\nWhy does the histogram become ineffective if the binwidth is too big (e.g. 1000 feet)? We lose too much information about the elevation of each hike.\nWhy does the histogram become ineffective if the binwidth is too small (e.g. 5 feet)? The hikes are separated too much, making it harder to see any trend between elevation values.\n\n\n\nExercise 11: Density Plots\nDensity plots are essentially smooth versions of the histogram. Instead of sorting observations into discrete bins, the “density” of observations is calculated across the entire range of outcomes. The greater the number of observations, the greater the density! The density is then scaled so that the area under the density curve always equals 1 and the area under any fraction of the curve represents the fraction of cases that lie in that range.\nCheck out a density plot of elevation. Notice that the y-axis (density) has no contextual interpretation – it’s a relative measure. The higher the density, the more common are elevations in that range.\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\nINTUITION CHECK: Before tweaking the code and thinking back to geom_bar() and geom_histogram(), how do you anticipate the following code will change the plot?\n\ngeom_density(color = \"blue\")\ngeom_density(fill = \"orange\") The line will be blue and the area under it will be filled orange.\n\nTRY IT! Test out those lines in the chunk below. Was your intuition correct? No, the ‘color’ parameter had no effect on the graph.\n\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  geom_density(color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_density(fill = \"orange\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamine the density plot. How does it compare to the histogram? What does it tell you about the typical elevation, variability / range in elevations, and shape of the distribution of elevations within this range? The distribution of data is much smoother in the density plot. It makes clear that the typical elevation is ~4200ft, but that there is a some variability in elevations. The shape of the distribution is similar to that of the histogram.\n\n\n\nExercise 12: Density Plots vs Histograms\nThe histogram and density plot both allow us to visualize the behavior of a quantitative variable: typical outcome, variability / range, shape, and outliers. What are the pros/cons of each? What do you like/not like about each? The density plot makes it easy to visualize the general trend of data, while the histogram makes it easy to understand what a typical outcome is.\n\n\nExercise 13: Code = communication\nWe obviously won’t be done until we talk about communication. All code above has a similar general structure (where the details can change):\n\nggplot(___, aes(x = ___)) + \n  geom___(color = \"___\", fill = \"___\") + \n  labs(x = \"___\", y = \"___\")\n\n\nThough not necessary to the code working, it’s common, good practice to indent or tab the lines of code after the first line (counterexample below). Why? It makes clear what lines are dependent on another function to run.\n\n\n# YUCK\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\ngeom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) +\nlabs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough not necessary to the code working, it’s common, good practice to put a line break after each + (counterexample below). Why? It becomes easier to understand the different components that make up a block of code.\n\n\n# YUCK \nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) + geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) + labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 14: Practice\n\nPart a\nPractice your viz skills to learn about some of the variables in one of the following datasets from the previous class:\n\n# Data on students in this class\nsurvey &lt;- read.csv(\"https://hash-mac.github.io/stat112site-s25/data/survey.csv\")\n\n# World Cup data\nworld_cup &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-11-29/worldcups.csv\")\n\nBar chart of World Cup winners from 1930 to 2018:\n\nggplot(world_cup, aes(x = winner)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"white\") +\n  labs(x = \"Nation\", y = \"Number of victories\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nCheck out the RStudio Data Visualization cheat sheet to learn more features of ggplot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck → Commit → Push\n\n\n\nWhen done, don’t forgot to click Render Book and check the resulting HTML files.
